- caching of subqueries: add "*" before the field name, like: 
  -Q "*journalId|020|select title as category, id as categoryId from
  JournalCategoryJoin, Category where JournalCategoryJoin.journalId = @ and
  Category.id < 449 and JournalCategoryJoin.categoryId = Category.id"

- noticed long closing for test 3 way join: on blue01.dartejos [select
 Article.id, abstract, title, firstName, lastName from Article, Author,
 ArticleAuthorJoin where Article.id = ArticleAuthorJoin.articleId and
 ArticleAuthorJoin.authorId = Author.id]
It turns out that MySQL sends all of the query, before allowing you to
close. So if you only want 3000 of a 20m record quey, you have to wait
thousands of seconds for it to complete as all of the unwanted records are
sent down to you.
* Solution: Take out explicit close for ResultSet, Statement and Connection. 
  usually nt a good idea, but these are only opened and closed once, so no
  problems.
  Also, I checked MySQL using 'show processlist' and the connection (process)
  goes away once the Java application shuts down (i.e. shorter time than
  sending all records over...) -GNewton
